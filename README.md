[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bee-jee/bee-jee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bee-jee/bee-jee)

BeeJee is a note taking app.
This project is an attempt for us to learn JS by building something alongside with doing tutorials.
## What does BeeJee mean?
The word note in Chinese is 笔记 which is transcribed to BiJi in Pinyin, hence BeeJee is chosen which sounds similar to the Chinese word for note.
## Architecture
The project is split into 2 parts API and Front-end:
- API: is written in TypeScript, which is compiled and ran on NodeJS.
- Front-end: is a Vue.Js app
## Development
To start development, using the following command to run the app:

```
npm i && npm start
```
This will install all the dependencies and execute the `start` script which is defined in package.json
