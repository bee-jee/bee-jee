# BeeJee
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bee-jee/bee-jee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bee-jee/bee-jee)

BeeJee is a note taking app.
This project is an attempt for us to learn React by building something alongside with doing tutorials.
## What does BeeJee mean?
The word note in Chinese is 笔记 which is transcribed to BiJi in Pinyin, hence BeeJee is chosen which sounds similar to the Chinese word for note.
## Architecture
The project is split into 2 parts API and Web:
- API: will be written in PHP, specifically utilise the Laravel Framework but instead of running via the LAMP/LEMP stack, this will be executed by [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/).
- Web: TBD
